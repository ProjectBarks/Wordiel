# Wordiel	

Inspired by [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/) I attempted to make an Open Source version of API that would allow developers to easily generate word clouds. This was a fun project to make because it required an extensive math knowledge and pushed my technical ability to the next level implementing and learning algorithms to make my tool more efficient.
